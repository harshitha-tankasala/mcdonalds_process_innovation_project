# 🍔 McDonald's Drive-Thru Process Innovation Project

Welcome to a deep-dive analysis and redesign of McDonald’s drive-thru operations using Six Sigma’s DMAIC framework. This project showcases how data, design thinking, and lean principles can transform customer experience and operational efficiency in the fast-paced world of Quick Service Restaurants (QSR).This project was done under the guidance of our subject professor Dennis Glacken at stevens institute of technology for process innovation subject along with my team of 3 graduate students.We have scored the highest in the class with this project.

## 🚀 Project Objective

To reduce total drive-thru service time and improve customer satisfaction by identifying and eliminating bottlenecks in McDonald's order fulfillment process. The project aligns tactical improvements with strategic goals to reclaim McDonald's leadership in the QSR drive-thru market.

## 🧠 Methodology

This project follows the **DMAIC** approach:
- **Define**: Establish project charter, objectives, and problem statement
- **Measure**: Collect and analyze service time data across various conditions
- **Analyze**: Identify root causes using Fishbone diagrams, Pareto charts, and value stream mapping
- **Improve**: Implement targeted solutions including dual-lane drive-thrus, digital order boards, and staff training
- **Control**: Monitor KPIs and sustain improvements through pilot testing and feedback loops

## 📊 Key Insights

- McDonald's lagged behind competitors like Wendy’s by up to 60 seconds in drive-thru service time
- Root causes included kitchen backlog, short staffing, equipment issues, and order complexity
- Weather and menu type significantly influenced service delays

## 💡 Solutions Implemented

| Solution                     | Impact  | Result                                      |
|-----------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| Dual Order Points           | High    | Reduced queue time by 35 seconds            |
| Digital Order Displays      | Medium  | Cut prep time by 20 seconds, reduced errors |
| FIFO Kitchen Workflow       | High    | Improved order fairness and predictability  |
| Staff Training & SOPs       | High    | Boosted processing speed, reduced turnover  |
| Voice-AI Order Assistant    | Medium  | Enhanced accuracy, freed up staff time      |

## 📈 Results

- **Average wait time** reduced from 6.5 to 4.0 minutes over 5 weeks
- **Order throughput** increased by 25–40% during peak hours
- **Customer satisfaction** rose from 4.1 to 4.6 (out of 5)
- **Service time** for breakfast orders dropped by 52%
